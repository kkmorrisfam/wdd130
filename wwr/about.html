                    outfitter industry. From our guides and staff to our high level of service,

            <h2>History</h2>        
            <p>Rafting is not something that we stumbled into, nor is it something we tried in college. 
                It is not something that we only do on a warm summer day. Rafting is our passion. We go 
                rafting because it is fun. We go rafting because it gets us outside. We go rafting because
                 we feel, it brings out the best in people.</p>
                <img src="images/compass.png" alt="Compass">
                <p>After almost 40 years of operating on the Wild and Scenic Klamath River as Redwood Wilderness
                 Adventures, the White Water Rafting Company merged the two companies in 2016. This is an exciting
                merger of two of the top Northern California River outfitters. We are now known as White Water 
                Rafting Company. We look forward to sharing the amazing Klamath and Smith Rivers with you year after year.
