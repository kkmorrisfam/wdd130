                    <h2>Lower Klamath River</h2>
                    <p>In the far northwestern corner of California, you’ll find the Klamath River, one of the first rivers to be granted
                     National Wild & Scenic status. From Oregon, the picturesque river winds its way through both the Cascade and Coast 
                     Mountain Ranges, providing ample recreational opportunities, before flowing into the Pacific Ocean. And while the 
                     Upper Klamath River offers more adventurous whitewater, it’s the Lower Klamath River that is ideal for first-timers 
                     and families with young kids. Most people run a Class III section of the Lower Klamath River from Happy Camp, CA to
                      the Green Riffle take-out, but for complete solitude, incredible birdlife and bouncy, easy Class II rapids suitable 
                      for the littlest rafters out there, you can run the approximately 18-mile stretch from the Sluice Box put-in back to Happy Camp. Regardless of which stretch you choose though, the Klamath’s signature warm waters may make swimming, rock jumping and beach time the highlight of this adventure.</p>

                    <h2>Biggest White Water: Cal Salmon River</h2>
                    <p>If you’re in search of some of the most challenging whitewater in California, the Cal Salmon River, 
                        which flows through California’s Coastal Range in the Trinity Alps, should be at the top of your list. 
                        The most popular trip on the Cal Salmon is the approximately 10-mile Nordheimer Run, which dishes out 
                        back-to-back Class IV+ rapids, interspersed with Class V doozies like Cascade, Last Chance and the big finale, 
                        boulder-strewn Freight Train Rapid. Considered an expert run, you should have ample experience before attempting 
                        to raft this steep, remote and incredibly scenic river.</p>
