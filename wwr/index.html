                <p>Rafting is not something that we stumbled into, nor is it something we tried in college.
                    It is not something that we only do on a warm summer day. Rafting is our passion. We go rafting 
                    because it is fun. We go rafting because it gets us outside. We go rafting because we feel, 
                    it brings out the best in people. We seek to ensure that you experience our country's
                    finest adventure - rafting.

                <p>We have been paddling rivers since the 80's and we wonâ€™t ever stop. Why? Because we are passionate
                    about our rivers, our environment, and our state (of mind). </p>

                <h3>THE RIVERS WE RUN</h3>
                <p>Our vision is to create a sustainable and equitable reality where our rivers 
                    are enjoyed and protected, a place where families and friends can be inspired and challenged.
                </p>    
                <p> White Water Rafting Company has been running rivers since we were first founded in 1985.  
                    While some things have changed over the years, we remain a family-run small business with 
                    the same passion for the river and the mission of leading others to experience it.
