                <p>Hi, my name is Kerri Morris. I live in the Pacific Northwest with my family.  
                    I love walks along the beach, kayaking in the river and visiting the Redwoods 
                    and all that nature has to offer.  I am also learning how to play the guitar 
                    with my son.  Itâ€™s been a fun adventure and I think we are both starting to get the hang of it.
                    I am currently enrolled in BYU Pathways program with two of my daughters.  We started 
                    BYU PathwayConnect together and this is our first semester taking different courses.  We are 
                    each here to support one another in this adventure.  I am working towards my first certificate in 
                    Web and computer programming.
                </p>
