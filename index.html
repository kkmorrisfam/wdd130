            <p>Hi, my name is Kerri Morris. I live in the Pacific Northwest with my family.  I love walks along the beach, kayaking in the river and visiting the Redwoods and all that nature has to offer.  I am also learning how to play the guitar with my son.  Itâ€™s been a fun adventure and I think we are both starting to get the hang of it.
